# Expense Tracker Project Enhancement Suggestions

Based on my analysis of your current expense tracker backend project, here are comprehensive suggestions for what more you can do to enhance and expand the functionality:

## üöÄ Current Project Status

Your project currently has:
- ‚úÖ Basic Spring Boot setup with Maven
- ‚úÖ User authentication and role-based authorization
- ‚úÖ Basic expense entry creation (POST only)
- ‚úÖ JPA entities for User, ExpenseEntry, and Role
- ‚úÖ Docker support with MySQL
- ‚úÖ Basic security configuration
- ‚úÖ Category enum (FOOD, TRANSPORT, ENTERTAINMENT, etc.)

## üîß Immediate Improvements (High Priority)

PUT /api/auth/expenses/{id} - Update expense
DELETE /api/auth/expenses/{id} - Delete expense
GET /api/auth/expenses/category/{category} - Get expenses by category
```

### 2. Enhanced Expense Filtering & Search
**Add query parameters for filtering**:
- Date range filtering
- Amount range filtering
- Category filtering

- Sorting options (date, amount, category)

### 3. User Management Endpoints
**Currently missing user management features**:
```java
GET /api/auth/profile - Get user profile
PUT /api/auth/profile - Update user profile
